## 1.IDENTIFY FEATURE

A sonar contactless, wireless water-level indicator, which can be fabricated for less than Rs. 2500, has been described. It is capable of measuring water levels up to four metres with an accuracy of less than 5mm.

## 2.STATE OF ART

The water-level indicator has two units: transmitter unit and receiver unit. Attach the contactless sonar sensor at a strategic location on the tank so that it can always get the reflected signal from the water surface. The best place would be at the centre of a circular tank’s lid on top, or at the intersection of the diagonals of a rectangular tank’s top. The calculated tank level will then be transmitted with a coded authorisation to the receiver unit.

## 3.4 W and 1 H

## WHEN

It can be used for the water level measurement in the water tanks using the sonar sensor which can kept under the water.

## WHO

Every person who want to calculate the water level measurement by automation by using the sonar sensor can use this.

## WHAT

For calculating water level measurements in water tanks by using sonar sensor by which we can know the measurement of the water in the water tanks.

## WHERE

It can be used in water tanks, water in lakes, swaps, and rivers.

## HOW

By using the sonar sensor we can use to measure water level in water tanks.

## 4.SWOT ANALYSIS

## Strength 

1.Water level can be measure automatically using sonar water level meter.
2. Since there is no physical contact used in the sensory system, it will be operational without any interruption. 

## Weakness  

1.Contactless sonar-level metres are there but their high cost is a deterrent.
2.If the transmitter stalls or its power supply gets interrupted, there is no way for the receiver to find out that the incoming signal is no longer valid.

## THREADS

At some point of time there is chance that sensor can be rust.

## 5.HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS

1.Atmega328 Microcontroller

2.Sonar Sensor.

3.RF Transmitter module.

4.RF Receiver module.

5.LCD 4*16.

## 6.LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS

1.Power Supply.

2.Availability of water in the tank.
